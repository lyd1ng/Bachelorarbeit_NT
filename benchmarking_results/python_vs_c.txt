The fdtd was implemented on a 2d universe containing a pml material
in python using numpy and in c.
The benchmarking parameters where:

len(x_indices) = len(y_indices) = 100
max_frequency = 1.5e6
samplerate_space = 40
samplerate_time = 10
pml_widht = pml_height = 20
ramped_sinus source
No geometry

In average the implementation in c was faster by a factor of XXX.
